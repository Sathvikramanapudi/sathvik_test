Once upon a time in the land of GitHub:

There was a team of developers working on a big project called "Project Phoenix."
The Master Branch:

The master branch was the main branch where the most stable version of the project lived.
Everyone agreed that only fully tested and approved changes would be merged into the master branch.
Creating New Branches:

To avoid disrupting the master branch, each developer created their own branch.
Alice created a branch named feature-login to work on the login functionality.
Bob created a branch named feature-dashboard to build the user dashboard.
